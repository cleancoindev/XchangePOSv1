XchangePOS v1.0 development tree

XchangePOS v1.0 is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.  This was offered and completed around April 5th and readied for swap into the Digifel community who had fallen victim to a scam.

The Xchange coin on the market is a stolen IP, done by Wizard and Kalcan.  They are not ethical, do not trust them with setting up a proper legal escrow.  The escrow they have set up puts you the user at risk of using an illegal unlicensed money transmitter service.  

They have failed to cover their own and your assets from possible legal or tax rammifications.  Beware, once a theif of IP, always a theif of IP.
