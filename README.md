XchangePOS v1.0 development tree

XchangePOS v1.0 is a PoS-based cryptocurrency.  This was offered and completed around April 5th and readied for swap into the Digifel community who had fallen victim to a scam and to appease the community for their desire for a swap out coin replacement that the old scammer did still control and later destroyed.  I was going to launch the coin and the 2 assistants refused to be ok with it and asked me to delay longer.  It wasn't until later in 2018, July, they pushed forward finally having figured out how to make wallets on windows properly and proceeded to edit the unlicensed QT wallets they have made private closed source.

The Xchange coin on the market is a stolen IP, done by Wizard and Kalcan, their ideas of using in wallet changes, and many others were stolen from conversations of a private nature between me as lead developer and them as coding assistants.  

They developed an ego and then turned on me and stole the majority of the premine of the coin I was supposed to supervise.  Kalcan hid the coins and then they told me to step down or they would kick me off the team.  I booted them from the discord server for Digifel as their coup would be doomed since they were not admin any longer once they turned on me and the community.  

They are not ethical, do not trust them with setting up a proper legal escrow.  The escrow they have set up puts you the user at risk of using an illegal unlicensed money transmitter service.  

They have failed to cover their own and your assets from possible legal or tax rammifications.  Beware, once a theif of IP, always a theif of IP.
